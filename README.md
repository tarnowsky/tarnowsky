# Hi! I'm Micha≈Ç Tarnowski, computer science student from Poland.

My main interests are mathematics and IT, but also rock music, acting, singing and dancing.
Since 2008 I have been a member of a musical group "Stowarzyszenie Teatralne INGENIUM", with which 
I have prepared and played several premieres and performances on stage.
I'm also vocalist, lead guitarist and text writer in a rock band. 
In August 2021 together we won the second place in the contest organized in belgium "Imagine Music Experience". 

To Computer Science brought me my Dad. On my 16th birthday He bought me books to learn Java and C, that he used to learn from.
His passion and mindfullness was always a mystery for me and I wonder I could have so much knowladge of what I'm doing someday.
Then, while Holidays, I read a book on Python in preparation for my Matura exam. I have written hundreds of lines of code, and here we are at the moment of writing this text.

I'm a patient and persistent person who pursues my goals. I like working in a group, I feel good as a leader. 
I am creative. I can just as well follow a marked path as well as discover and invent my own.

My disadvantages are: a large part of the time spent on social media, malaise when I do not stand out clearly in a given group.
